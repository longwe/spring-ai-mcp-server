    Logback Configuration for MCP Server

    IMPORTANT: Logging is completely disabled for MCP STDIO servers.

    The Model Context Protocol communicates via JSON messages over stdin/stdout.
    Any log output to the console would corrupt the protocol and cause errors.

    If you need to debug, consider:
    1. Logging to a file instead of console
    2. Using a separate debug mode that doesn't use STDIO transport

<configuration>
    <!-- Disable all logging to keep STDIO streams clean -->
    <root level="OFF" />
